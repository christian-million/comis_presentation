::: notes
I'm starting us off today with a dive into the thrilling topic of MIS data types and formats,
so we're gonna need some humor throughout.
:::

## Goals

### Main Goal

- Showcase benefits of developing internal packages with R.

::: columns
::: column
### Along the way...

- Inspire!

- Use `comis` as a motivating example

- Why is package development worthwhile?

- Learn **too** much about MIS files.
:::

:::column
```r
library(comis)

# Read Referential File
CB <- read_ref("path/to/CB223.txt")

# Read Submission File
XB <- read_sub("path/to/U59217XB.DAT")
```
:::
:::

::: notes
Understand why these three lines of code are so beautiful to me.
:::

## What is `comis`?

An internally developed R package

::: columns 
::: {.column .incremental}

### Purpose

Read and Format:

- MIS __Submission__ Files

- MIS __Referential__ Files

:::



:::

# MIS Data: What and Why?

::: notes
-   What are MIS files?

-   Why are they useful?

-   What about MIS files requires a dedicated package?

-   MIS 101 - In order to better understand our specific institutions needs, we need a very brief intro to MIS
:::

## MIS 101 - Submission Files

::: columns
::: column
Every term, someone at your college converts SIS data into `.DAT` files, using the file specs found in the [Data Element Dictionary](https://webdata.cccco.edu/ded/ded.htm).

These are `submission` files.
:::

::: column
![](img/sub_file_dir.png)
![](img/sub_file_example.png)
:::
:::


## MIS 101 - Referential Files

::: columns

::: column
After submission, colleges request `referential` files from the CCCCO.


These contain elements derived from submission files, explicit formatting, and additional student information.
:::

## MIS is Important Data

We want to analyze it!

### Uses

- Monitoring Student Success and Equity

- Accountability
    
- Categorical Funding (EOPS, DSPS, Perkins, ...)

- Student Centered Funding Formula

- Research

- ...

::: notes
-   These are just some of the uses. We want to analyze it!

-   In order to use the data, we need to get into an analysis tool.

-   Whether that's R / Excel / STATA / SPSS

# The Challenge

## Submission Files - Challenges

:::: columns
::: column
-   ~ 25 files | 396 elements

-   Fixed Width Format

-   No Column Names

-   Numbers that should be characters / dates

-   Missing values (`NA`)

-   Trailing white space

-   Implied decimal points
:::

::: column

![](img/sub_file_example.png){.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top="25%" right="1%" width="50%"}
![](img/fwf.png){.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top="25%" right="1%" width="50%"}

![](img/sub_fwf.png){.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top="25%" right="1%" width="50%"}
![](img/num_as_char.png){.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top="25%" right="1%" width="50%"}
![](img/num_as_date.png){.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top="25%" right="1%" width="50%"}
![](img/trailing_white_space.png){.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top="25%" right="1%" width="50%"}
![](img/implied_decimal.png){.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top="25%" right="1%" width="50%"}
:::
::::

## Referential Files - Challenges

-   ~ 27 files | 406 elements

-   Tab Delimited :)

-   No Column Names

-   Numbers that should be characters / dates

-   Missing values (`NA`)

-   Trailing white space

-   ~~Implied decimal points~~

-   *Different date format than submission file.*

## Yikes

-   A lot to re-remember

-   Cognitively taxing to implement

-   Takes time

-   Updates to multiple scripts

-   Copy / paste errors

-   Makes scripts more difficult to read

-   Unfulfilling

-   Lots of overhead before analysis can begin

::: notes
If you were to try to read in just two MIS submission files, it would look like this:
:::

## Before `comis`

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

CB_col_names <- c('GI90', 'GI01','GI03', paste0("CB0",0:9), paste0("CB",10:27), "Filler")
CB_col_types <- rep("c", length(CB_col_names))
CB_col_width <- CB <- c(2,3,3,12,12,68,6,1,1,length(109:112),length(113:116),1,1,1,1,1,1,6,8,length(137:148),length(149:160),length(161:172),7,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,26)

XB_col_names <- c('GI90', 'GI01', 'GI03', 'GI02', 'CB01', paste0('XB0',0:9), 'XB10', 'XB11', 'XB12', 'CB00', 'Filler')
XB_col_types <- rep("c", length(XB_col_names))
XB_col_width <- c(2,3,3,3,12,6,1,6,6,1,length(44:47), length(48:51),1,1,1,1,length(56:61), 1, 12,7)

CB_src <- readr::read_tsv("path/to/U59223CB.dat",
                           col_names = CB_col_names,
                           col_types = CB_col_types,
                           trim_ws = TRUE)
                           
XB_src <- readr::read_tsv("path/to/U59223XB.dat",
                           col_names = CB_col_names, # copy / paste errors
                           col_types = XB_col_types,
                           trim_ws = TRUE)

CB <- CB_src |>
    mutate(dates = date_cleaning_code(),
           units = implicit_decimal_code())
           
XB <- XB_src |>
    mutate(dates = date_cleaning_code(),
           units = implicit_decimal_code())
```

::: notes
You don't need to understand this code that doesn't run - what's important is that it's ugly and overwhelming
:::

![](img/ew.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## After `comis` {.incremental}

``` r
library(comis)

CB <- read_sub("path/to/U59223CB.dat")
XB <- read_sub("path/to/U59223XB.dat")
```

::: notes
- So much easier to tell what's happening

- Sit here and take a breath

## Additional Features

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Contains useful data found on CCCCO websites

-   Read many files at once

-   Read from repo

-   Use DED Name or Descriptive Name
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top="25%" right="1%" width="55%"}
```r
library(dplyr)
library(comis)

read_ref_repo("CB", c("217", "223")) |>
    left_join(top_codes, by = c("CB03" = "top_code")) |>
    left_join(colleges, by = c("GI01")) |>
    filter(vocational == "Y",
           institution == "COLUMBIA")
```
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top="25%" right="1%" width="55%"}
```r
library(comis)

# Reads many files of same "domain" at once
read_sub(c("U59223CB.DAT", "U59217CB.DAT"))


read_ref(c("CB217.txt", "CB223.DAT"))
```
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top="25%" right="1%" width="55%"}
```r
library(comis)

# Set in .Rprofile or .Renviron
options(comis.repo.referential = "path/to/ref/repo/")

read_ref_repo("CB", c("217", "223"))
```
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-out .absolute top="25%" right="1%" width="55%"}
```r
library(comis)

# Column names are DED Codes.
# like "GI01", "CB00", "CB01"
read_ref_repo("CB", "217")

# Column names are words.
# like "COLLEGE_ID", "COURSE_ID", "CONTROL_NUMBER"
read_ref("CB", "217", desc = TRUE)
```

## Benefits of `comis` {.incremental}

-   Easier to tell what's happening

-   Reduces cognitive overhead

-   Get to analysis faster and with more confidence

-   Documentation contained within the package

-   Updates made in one spot (instead of throughout various scripts)

-   **Shifts focus to what's important - Using the Data**

## Why Develop Internal R Packages?

-   Addresses problems specific to the institution

-   Reasonable defaults

-   Abstracts common tasks

-   Maintainable

-   Share code with others

-   Documentation / Vignettes

## Other "Internal" R Packages

::: columns

::: column
### Examples

- [DisImpact](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=DisImpact) *("internal" to CCCCO)*

- yccdDB *(creates and manages DB connections / queries)*

- hub *(.Rmd/.Qmd storage and usage monitoring)*
:::

::: column
### Ideas

-   Reading/Process other CCC Files: SEA, VFS, SCFF, etc... 

-   yccdTemplates *(project / analysis / report templates)*

-   yccdThemes *(branding graphs / reports)*

-   yccdTerms *(help with term math / formatting)*
